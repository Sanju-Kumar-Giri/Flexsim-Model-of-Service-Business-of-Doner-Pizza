We try to mimic the operation or the service business of D√∂ner Pizza using Flexsim Simulation Software. At first, we developed the original operation of D√∂ner Pizza and analysed different results and we found some interesting results that we could solve in our improvement model, so on top of the original model we created another model which is the improvement one where we propose to distribute the work between the cashier and chef equally and increase the number of ovens from 2 to total of 4 ovens to full-fill the demand or the order they get and in this way, they can increase their revenue, initially, they need to spend money for the new ovens they need to buy but later in 6-8 months they will be breakeven.
